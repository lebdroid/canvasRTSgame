# canvas-RTS-game

This is a fun project where I'm exploring game development. The project includes a character sprite and tiles that I've used in my implementation.

## Character Sprite

The character sprite used in this project is sourced from the LPC Runcycle and Diagonal Walkcycle collection, available at [OpenGameArt.org](https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-runcycle-and-diagonal-walkcycle). I have scaled the sprite to 32x32 pixels to fit my project's requirements. Please refer to the original source for additional details about the sprite and its licensing terms.

## Tiles

The tiles used in this project are from the RPG Nature Tileset, created by [Stealthix](https://stealthix.itch.io/rpg-nature-tileset). For specific information about the tileset and its usage rights, please visit the original source.
